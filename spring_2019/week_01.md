## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I reviewed CSS and HTML and learned how to use bootstrap. I also tried to code for pop-up windows for the websites.

## This Week's Plan

> Keep coding for pop-up windows while learning more about framework and web design.


## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing specific about the project but I am still getting used to Github. I am not familiar with command lines such as commit.
